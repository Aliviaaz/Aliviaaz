- data science & machine learning
- full-stack web development
- databases (currently learning about geospatial databases!)

I want to work on technology that creates a positive impact on the environment. 💜

🌱 Currently working on:
- My senior year capstone project: building a cloud-hosted geospatial database for [Resilient Forestry](https://resilientforestry.com/)
- Refining and documenting projects from previous classes, like [this wishlist creation website](https://github.com/Aliviaaz/WishCloud) from my Software as a Service class
- Learning about Big Data Analytics

🛠️ Tools & technologies:
- Languages: Python ⭐️, C++ ⭐️, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Frameworks: Node.js, Express
- Databases: MongoDB
- Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly
- Other: Git, REST APIs, Cloud deployment (Azure, Github actions)
⭐️ = most proficient in

## More about my developer story:

💡 Background & interests:
- I first learned about coding in elementary school from Javascript, HTML, and CSS tutorials on Khan Academy.
- I became more interested in CS in high school because of AP classes and my school's Robotics club. As part of this club, I learned about machine learning and worked on a yearlong project training a neural network to read handwritten Chinese characters. This project inspired me to major in Computer Science in college, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
- My interests in Computer Science have changed a lot over time, but currently I'm looking to learn more about geospatial information systems (GIS).

⭐ Career highlights:
- **Capstone Project** — A team-based project focused on creating a cloud-hosted geospatial database. I worked on 
  *Note: This repository is private, but I’m happy to discuss the project in more detail.*

🎯 What I’m looking for:
- Entry-level roles that balance technical skills with teamwork and communication
- Experiences aligned with my values: sustainability and working for the common good
